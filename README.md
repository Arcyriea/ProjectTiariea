# ProjectTiariea

This is the first game project of my own that I started, in which I began to understands common mechanics development practices, and how they works.

Artworks from my DeviantArt may be delivered to this project. I also help drawing spritesheets for the characters as well as units

Some sound assets are borrowed from Realspace 3, Battleship Forever.
