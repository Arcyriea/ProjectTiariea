# ProjectTiariea

This is the first game project of my own that I started, in which I began to understands common mechanics development practices, and how they works.

Artworks from my DeviantArt may be delivered to this project. I also help drawing spritesheets for the characters as well as units

Some sound assets are borrowed from Realspace 3, Battleship Forever.

I would just try to find ways to port this over to Godot or Unreal if this were to be developed and published to be an actual game, since it's currently developed in Unity atm.
Update: Just recently found out about the existence of Stride, in which it looks promising and many of its aspects works like Unity, however I would need to find a tool to convert Unity codes to Stride codebase.
